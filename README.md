weather app
============

this application was made using java and javafx

it's an application with three tabs to view weather data that's stored within separate csv files per city

tab 1 - data summary
--------------------

this tab allows you to select a city to view a summary of data for what's selected

you are then able to generate a report for all cities from here or click to go through to tab 2 for a better visualisation of the data

tab 2 - data visualisation
--------------------------

here you have multiple charts of different statistics each

you can add only the years of data supported for the chosen city

you can clear the graphs, revert them to how you entered the tab too

tab 3 - report view
-------------------

here is a view of the report that's been generated in a separate folder in a format taking into account lengths of city names

**this was a university project and definitely needs refactoring but it works by simply installing java in vscode now whereas it was an intellij project prior**
